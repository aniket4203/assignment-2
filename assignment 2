While loop Ri = [0.2, 0.25, 0.45, 0.5, 0.75, 0.8, 0.9, 1.15]
While loop Phi= 0.2625
As rainfall intensity 0.2 cm/hr <0.2625, so no contribution towards runoff
Assumption of 7 pulses have rainfall excess fails, so remove least rain fall intensity <0.2625
Excess rainfall intensities (sorted) = [0.25, 0.45, 0.5, 0.75, 0.8, 0. 9, 1.15] In next trial assume no. of
